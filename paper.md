# Statement of Need

Digital distraction poses a significant and pervasive challenge to productivity and cognitive well-being, particularly in academic and professional settings [@academic_distraction_example]. While numerous productivity and website-blocking tools exist (e.g., StayFocusd, Freedom), many rely on server-side architecture to store user-defined block lists, focus session data, and usage logs. This design choice creates an inherent privacy vulnerability, as sensitive behavioral patterns—data explicitly related to a user's struggle with distraction—are transferred and stored on third-party servers, exposing users to the risk of data breaches and behavioral profiling [@privacy_concern_citation].

The **DigiFocus** Chrome Extension is presented as a secure, client-side solution to this architectural problem. Developed using **JavaScript (React), HTML, and CSS**, DigiFocus allows users to configure and strictly enforce website block lists for defined focus periods.

# Functionality and Architecture

DigiFocus is designed around two core features:

1.  **Time-Bound Blocking:** Users define a set of distracting URLs and initiate a focus session for a specific duration. During this session, attempts to navigate to any blocked site are immediately redirected to a neutral, non-distracting page, ensuring adherence to the focus goal.
2.  **Privacy-First Architecture:** Crucially, all user data—including the block list, focus session timers, and usage logs—is stored exclusively using the Chrome Extension's **local storage APIs**. This approach ensures that zero user data ever leaves the client's machine, eliminating the security and privacy risks associated with server-dependent focus applications.

DigiFocus offers a practical, privacy-centric alternative for individuals seeking digital focus without compromising their personal data, making the tool a valuable contribution to the open-source software ecosystem in the fields of human-computer interaction and computer security.
